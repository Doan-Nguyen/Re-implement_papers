## 1.1 Multi-Oriented Text Detection with Fully Convolution Networks

## 1.2 Abstract 

+ Both local & global cues (~signal) for localizing text lines in a coarse-to-fine (scratch) procedure.

+ Process:
    - 1st: FCN to predict the salient (important) map of text regions
    - 2nd: Text line are estimated by { the salient map + character components}
    - 3th: Other FCN classifiers to predict the centroid of each characters.

# 6. To understand the papers deeply 

## To understand the Math 

    + Read through & take detailed notes

    + Re-derive it from scratch 

## To understand the code 
    + Run open sources codes 

    + Re-implement from scratch
